# Configure VPN settings in Microsoft Intune for devices running Windows Phone 8.1

[!INCLUDE [azure_portal](./includes/azure_portal.md)]

This article shows you the Intune settings you can use to configure VPN connections on devices running Windows Phone 8.1.


Depending on the settings you choose, not all values in the following list are configurable.

## Base VPN settings

- **Apply all settings to Windows Phone 8.1 only** - This is a setting you can configure in the Intune classic portal. In the Azure portal, this setting cannot be changed. If this is set to **Configured**, any settings are only applied to Windows Phone 8.1 devices. If set to **Not Configured**, these settings also apply to Windows 10 Mobile devices.
- **Connection name** - Enter a name for this connection. Users see this name when they browse their device for the list of available VPN connections.
- **Authentication method** - Choose how devices authenticate to the VPN server from:
    - **Certificates** - Under **Authentication certificate**, Choose a SCEP or PKCS certificate profile you previously created to authenticate the connection. For more details about certificate profiles, see [How to configure certificates](certificates-configure.md).
    - **Username and password** - End users must supply a username and password to log into the VPN server.
- **Servers** - Add one or more VPN servers that devices connect to.
    - **Add** - Opens the **Add Row** blade where you can specify the following information:
        - **Description** - Specify a descriptive name for the server like **Contoso VPN server**.
        - **IP address or FQDN** - Provide the IP address or fully qualified domain name of the VPN server that devices connect to. Examples: **192.168.1.1**, **vpn.contoso.com**.
        - **Default server** - Enables this server as the default server that devices use to establish the connection. Make sure to set only one server as the default.
    - **Import** - Browse to a file containing a comma-separated list of servers in the format description, IP address or FQDN, Default server. Choose **OK** to import these into the **Servers** list.
    - **Export** - Exports the list of servers to a comma-separated-values (csv) file.

- **Bypass VPN on company Wi-Fi network** - Enable this option to specify that the VPN connections are not used when the device is connected to the company Wi-Fi network.
- **Bypass VPN on home Wi-Fi network** - Enable this option to specify that the VPN connection is not used when the device is connected to a home Wi-Fi network.

- **Connection type** - Select the VPN connection type from the following list of vendors:
    - **Check Point Capsule VPN**
    - **SonicWall Mobile Connect**
    - **F5 Edge Client**
    - **Pulse Secure**

- **Login group or domain** (SonicWall Mobile Connect only) - Specify the name of the login group or domain that you want to connect to.
- **Role** (Pulse Secure only) - Specify the name of the user role that has access to this connection. A user role defines personal settings and options, and it enables or disables certain access features.
- **Realm** (Pulse Secure only) - Specify the name of the authentication realm that you want to use. An authentication realm is a grouping of authentication resources that the Pulse Secure connection type uses.

- **DNS suffix search list** - **Add** one or more DNS suffices. Each DNS suffix that you specify is searched when connecting to a website by using a short name. For example, specify the DNS suffixes **domain1.contoso.com** and **domain2.contoso.com**, visit the URL `http://mywebsite`, and the URLs `http://mywebsite.domain1.contoso.com` and `http://mywebsite.domain2.contoso.com` is searched.

- **Custom XML** - Specify any custom XML commands that configure the VPN connection.

    **Example for Pulse Secure:**

```xml
    <pulse-schema><isSingleSignOnCredential>true</isSingleSignOnCredential></pulse-schema>
```

**Example for CheckPoint Mobile VPN:**

```xml
    <CheckPointVPN port="443" name="CheckPointSelfhost" sso="true" debug="3" />
```

**Example for SonicWall Mobile Connect:**

```xml
<MobileConnect><Compression>false</Compression><debugLogging>True</debugLogging><packetCapture>False</packetCapture></MobileConnect>
```

**Example for F5 Edge Client:**

```xml
    <f5-vpn-conf><single-sign-on-credential /></f5-vpn-conf>
```

Refer to each manufacturer's VPN documentation for more information about how to write custom XML commands.

- **Split tunneling** - **Enable** or **Disable** this option that lets devices decide which connection to use depending on the traffic. For example, a user in a hotel uses the VPN connection to access work files, but use the hotel's standard network for regular web browsing.




## Proxy settings

- **Automatically detect proxy settings** - If your VPN server requires a proxy server for the connection, specify whether you want devices to automatically detect the connection settings. For more information, see your Windows Server documentation.
- **Automatic configuration script** - Use a file to configure the proxy server. Enter the **Proxy server URL** (for example `http://proxy.contoso.com`) which contains the configuration file.
- **Use proxy server** - Enable this option if you want to manually enter the proxy server settings.
    - **Address** - Enter the proxy server address (as an IP address).
    - **Port number** - Enter the port number associated with the proxy server.
- **Bypass proxy for local addresses** - If your VPN server requires a proxy server for the connection, select this option if you do not want to use the proxy server for local addresses that you specify. For more information, see your Windows Server documentation.
